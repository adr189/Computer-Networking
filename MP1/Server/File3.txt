The term hypertext was coined by Ted Nelson in 1965 in the Xanadu Project, 
which was in turn inspired by Vannevar Bush's 1930s vision of the microfilm-based information retrieval and management "memex" system described in his 1945 essay "As We May Think".
Tim Berners-Lee and his team at CERN are credited with inventing the original HTTP, 
along with HTML and the associated technology for a web server and a text-based web browser.
Berners-Lee first proposed the "WorldWideWeb" project in 1989—now known as the World Wide Web.
